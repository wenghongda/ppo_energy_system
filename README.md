# ppo_energy_system
## In energy_system.py, a energy system including photovoltaic panels, wind turbines, fuel cell, electrolyser, hydrogen storage tank is described.
## In PPO.py, the complete algorithm of ppo is presented.
## In model.py, the actor and critic network is presented to give the action and value of this action respectively.
## In reward.py, I try to give the reward function of this energy system. However, the reward function is still being designed to get the best result.
